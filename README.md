# Java-Hotel-Room-Availability
Java project to simulate checking for room availability and reserving a room on the day.

Created to as part of a Java training course. A simple app that runs on the console.
It gets user input from a Scanner class and searches for the available rooms in a
hotel. If a room is available, it can then be reserved. Code was tested using JUnit.
